# RFID-Based Attendance System using Arduino

![RFID Attendance System Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Arduino%20RFID-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=arduino)
  
A simple, low-cost, and efficient RFID-based attendance system built using an Arduino UNO, MFRC522 RFID module, and a 16x2 LCD display. This project reads RFID tags, identifies students, and logs their attendance visually using LEDs and a buzzer for feedback.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- RFID card detection using MFRC522 module
- Student identification using UID matching
- Visual feedback using 16x2 LCD
- Green LED and buzzer for authorized access
- Red LED and buzzer alert for unauthorized access
- Easy to set up and extend (supports SD card, RTC, Wi-Fi, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE** from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Install the Required Libraries** via Library Manager:
   - `MFRC522` (by GithubCommunity)
   - `LiquidCrystal`
3. **Clone or Download this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RFID-Attendance-System.git
   ```
4. **Upload `main.ino` to Arduino UNO**
5. **Wire the circuit as per the diagram above**
6. **Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate** to view UID logs

## üìã RFID UIDs Configuration

| Student Name | RFID UID        |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Student 01   | C4 C0 97 3F      |
| Student 02   | D3 E4 47 DA      |

> You can add more UIDs directly in the code inside the `loop()` function.

---

## üéØ How It Works

1. The LCD prompts: `SHOW YOUR ID CARD`
2. When an RFID tag is scanned:
   - If **UID is valid**, it shows student name and `PRESENT`, activates green LED and buzzer briefly.
   - If **UID is invalid**, it shows `UNAUTHORIZE ACCESS`, activates red LED and buzzer for 2 seconds.
3. After display, the screen resets for the next scan.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Save attendance logs to SD Card
- Add Real-Time Clock (RTC) module for timestamping
- Send attendance data to cloud or server via Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32)
- Admin panel with card registration and deletion
- OLED or Touchscreen UI interface
